\chapter{Introduction}
The Mining Industry is as important part of the global economy. It depends on digital technologies to improve operations, safety, and sustainability. However, this reliance on technology exposes the industry to significant cyber threats that can disrupt operations, compromise safety, and cause financial loss and environmental harm. Given these risks, the need for effective cyber threat detection in mining is more urgent than ever. Traditional and reactive cybersecurity measures often fail to address the complex and evolving threats specific to the mining sector. This has led to the growing importance of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) System for the mining sector, which proactively detect, analyze, and respond to potential threats using intelligence feeds. These systems collect and analyze data from multiple sources, helping organizations identify and mitigate risks before they cause damage. Despite potential threats, the urgency for effective cyber threat detection in mining has never been greater. Traditional reactive cybersecurity measures used in the sector often fall short of addressing the sophisticated and evolving threats unique to the mining sector. This research aims to fill these gaps by developping tailored Cyber Threat Intelligence System Framework specifically for the mining industry. The CTI Framework will use advanced data analytics and machine learning algorithms to detect patterns and anomalies in threats datam and it will improve the industry’s ability to defend against cyber-attacks. Additionally, this study will examine the ethical implications of implementing such a system, ensuring it meets both technical and ethical standards. By designing a CTI system tailored to the mining sector, this research will address a critical need and contribute to the broader field of cybersecurity.

\section{Problem Statement}
Mining Industry plays a crucial role in global economic development. Mining operations are adopting digital technologies rapidly to enhance productivity, safety, and efficiency. These are becoming more vulnerable to cyber threats. These threats can disrupt operations, can compromise sensitive data, can cause financial loss, and even it can endanger lives and the environment. Evolution Mining is an Australian gold mining company. It suffered a ransomware attack in August 2024 on its IT systems, which, though swiftly contained, underscored the industry's susceptibility to cyber threats. A month earlier, in July 2024, Sibanye-Stillwater also faced a cyberattack, leading to temporary IT system outages and manual processing in some of its operations. Norsk Hydro is a major metals and mining company. It experienced a ransomware attack in 2020 that caused significant operational shutdowns and millions in losses.
An attack on a South American in 2017 on a mining firm compromised sensitive geological data. An Australian mining company suffered unauthorized access in 2019 which disrupted automated processes and risked worker safety.
These incidents highlight the urgent necessity for robust, proactive cybersecurity measures to protect the industry from evolving threats.

\chapter{Background and Literature Review}
\section{Introduction}
This chapter presents the background and literature review essential for developing a Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) framework tailored specifically for the mining industry. As industries become increasingly digitalized, the mining sector has not remained isolated from growing cybersecurity risks. This chapter begins by exploring the fundamental concepts of CTI systems and examines current approaches to cybersecurity in industrial sectors with a focus on mining. It discusses methods for collecting and analyzing cyber threat data, such as network logs and open-source intelligence, which are crucial for understanding the threat landscape specific to mining operations.

A key objective of this research is to investigate advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques that can improve the detection of patterns and anomalies in cyber threats. The literature review assesses relevant studies that address these techniques within industrial contexts, including those applicable to mining. Finally, this chapter also critically examines ethical considerations in implementing a CTI framework, acknowledging the importance of aligning with ethical standards and regulations to ensure both data security and industry compliance. These topics collectively provide the foundation for addressing the research questions and objectives, setting the stage for a comprehensive, ethically-sound CTI system for the mining industry.
\subsection{Background}
Cybersecurity initiatives play a crucial role in strategic decision-making within Industry 4.0, aligning digital operations with sustainable solutions \citet{medoh2022future}. The integration of advanced computing, communication technologies, and IoT-cloud infrastructure into critical systems like the Smart Grid and industrial cyber-physical systems (CPS) has introduced significant cybersecurity challenges. The Smart Grid, designed to enhance power system efficiency and reliability, now faces vulnerabilities due to the extensive interconnection of electronic devices, which impacts infrastructure stability and security. Similarly, industrial CPSs—including systems for the mining industries—rely on SCADA for infrastructure monitoring and control, yet traditional SCADA lacks adequate security measures for the complexities of IoT-cloud integration. This transformation exposes critical infrastructures to cyber threats, demanding updated countermeasures, secure protocols, and extensive research to address evolving vulnerabilities in these next-generation systems \citet{wang2013cyber} and \citet{sajid2016cloud}.

\chapter{Research Methodology}
\section{Research design}
\section{Methods}The research will follow a comprehensive, multi-phase approach tailored to address the
unique cybersecurity challenges encountered by the mining industry. The process will begin
with a requirements analysis, which will involve collecting stakeholder opinions and reviewing
relevant literature to identify specific needs and gaps in current cybersecurity frameworks.
Then, during the framework development phase, a customized architecture will be developed,
integrating data from various sources, such as network logs and open-source intelligence
feeds. Following this, real-time threat data will be collected and aggregated, which will then
be analyzed using advanced machine learning techniques like to detect patterns, classifying
and clustering the logs and anomalies. Ethical considerations will be carefully examined to
ensure compliance with industry regulations and data privacy standards. A prototype of the
CTI System will be developed and tested in a controlled environment to evaluate its
effectiveness. Then, the system’s performance will be assessed, and detailed documentation
will be prepared, offering insights and recommendations for practical implementation within
the mining industry.

\subsection{Pre-Modelling Phase}
The pre-modelling phase focuses on the initial setup and preparation needed to build an effective Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) system. It includes data collection, data preprocessing, and defining the threat intelligence goals specific to the mining industry.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Collection}: Raw data is collected from various sources such as network logs, open-source intelligence (OSINT) feeds, and vendor-specific threat intelligence reports. In mining operations, sensor and operational data can also be leveraged to detect abnormal patterns in the network.
    \item \textbf{Data Preprocessing}: The collected data is cleaned and transformed into a usable format. This involves handling missing data, removing duplicates, and normalizing data formats. Feature extraction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be applied to reduce noise.
    \item \textbf{Data Labeling}: For supervised learning, historical data is labeled by domain experts as normal or malicious based on past incidents.
    \item \textbf{Goal Definition}: Specific objectives are defined, such as detecting ransomware, Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), or insider threats, which will influence the models and algorithms chosen in the next phase.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Modelling Phase}
The modelling phase involves building machine learning models that predict and detect cyber threats based on the pre-processed data.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model Selection}: Machine learning models such as decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVMs), or neural networks are selected based on the data type and threat scenarios.
    \item \textbf{Feature Engineering}: Relevant features are engineered to improve the model’s ability to detect cyber threats. Time-series analysis may be used for real-time threat detection in operational environments.
    \item \textbf{Model Training}: Models are trained using supervised learning on labeled data or unsupervised learning on unlabelled data to detect anomalies. Cross-validation techniques are used to avoid overfitting.
    \item \textbf{Threat Classification}: The trained model is used to classify network activity or system behavior into predefined threat categories (e.g., malware, phishing, Denial of Service attacks).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Post-Modelling Phase}
After building the models, the post-modelling phase focuses on evaluation, validation, and deployment.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model Validation}: Models are validated using test datasets. Key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are used to measure the model’s effectiveness.
    \item \textbf{Model Tuning}: Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., grid search or random search) is used to optimize the model. This process involves adjusting key parameters to improve performance.
    \item \textbf{Deployment Readiness}: Once validated, the model is integrated into existing systems (e.g., Security Information and Event Management systems) for real-time threat detection. The model undergoes stress testing to ensure it can handle real-time data streams.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
The experimental setup defines how the CTI models are tested in a controlled environment before full deployment.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Test Environment Setup}: A simulated or controlled mining network is created, including virtual machines, network traffic simulators, and log generators to mimic realistic scenarios.
    \item \textbf{Data Injection}: Historical data and simulated attack data are injected into the system to evaluate its ability to detect and respond to various threats.
    \item \textbf{Performance Measurement}: The system’s performance is measured using metrics such as detection rate, false alarm rate, and response time. Resource usage (CPU, memory) is also monitored to ensure scalability.
    \item \textbf{Comparison with Existing Systems}: The CTI framework’s performance is compared to existing cybersecurity systems in the mining industry to assess improvements.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Optimization and Training Models}
The optimization and training phase focuses on refining the models to maximize their performance and efficiency.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hyperparameter Optimization}: Techniques such as grid search or Bayesian optimization are used to identify the best hyperparameters (e.g., learning rates, kernel functions) to improve detection accuracy.
    \item \textbf{Continuous Learning}: As new threats emerge, the model is retrained with updated data. Incremental learning or transfer learning methods may be used to update the model without complete retraining.
    \item \textbf{Efficiency Optimization}: The model is optimized for real-time performance through techniques such as model pruning, quantization, or the use of lightweight architectures.
    \item \textbf{Final Model Training}: The final optimized model is trained on the entire dataset to ensure robustness and accuracy. It is then ready for deployment into the CTI system.
\end{itemize}
